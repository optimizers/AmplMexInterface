Matlab MEX Interface to AMPL
============================

This is a Matlab interface to the [Ampl Solver Library](http://www.netlib.org/ampl/solvers/). It is setup as a Matlab [package](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/scoping-classes-with-packages.html), which means that the enclosing directory *must* be named `+ampl`.

Clone it this way:

    git clone git@github.com:optimizers/AmplMexInterface.git +ampl

Supports both dense and sparse models.
    
Enjoy!
